            <h2>Project Experience</h2>
            <p>In this project, I really enjoyed working as part of a group because it allowed us to share ideas, collaborate, and support each other throughout the process. One of the most challenging parts for me was understanding how the classes worked in the code, as it was a new and complex concept that I hadn’t fully grasped yet. To overcome this challenge, I asked Pak John for help, and he kindly guided me through it and helped clarify how everything functioned—heehee! If I had the chance to go back and do the project again, I would make sure to take more detailed notes beforehand so I could better understand the material and feel more confident in tackling those tricky parts on my own.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>During this project, I learned that small details—like tiny mistakes or typos—can have a big impact on how the code works. Even a single misplaced character can cause the entire program to stop running correctly. One of the problems I ran into was dealing with typos, which were sometimes hard to spot but made a big difference. I solved this issue by slowing down and carefully checking my typing, making sure each line of code was accurate. This experience taught me that solving problems with code is a lot like working on a craft project—you have to be patient, precise, and pay close attention to the little things in order to get everything just right.</p>
            <p>While building the project, I used tools like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and CodePen to write and test my code. These platforms were really helpful, but sometimes they didn’t provide prompts or hints when I got stuck, so I had to engineer my own solutions. This pushed me to think more critically and independently. I realized that being an engineer doesn’t just mean following instructions—it means figuring things out on your own, problem-solving creatively, and finding a way forward even when the tools don’t give you all the answers.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Even though AI can now build websites and assist with coding, I still believe it’s important to learn how to do it myself. Understanding how to code is a valuable skill that can open up many opportunities in the future. Now that I’ve built a website on my own, I have a much better understanding of how coding works and how everything fits together behind the scenes. If I only relied on AI to do the work for me, I might miss out on truly learning the concepts and developing my problem-solving skills. Knowing how to build something from scratch gives me more control and confidence—it means that I can adapt, create, and even thrive in a future where I don’t always have to depend on AI to get things done.

            </p> This project has helped me grow as a student because it made me realize that I can accomplish things on my own, even without relying on AI. It gave me the confidence to trust my own thinking and problem-solving abilities. Through this experience, I learned the importance of using my own mind—figuring things out, making decisions, and learning through trial and error. While AI can be a helpful tool, this project reminded me that it's also powerful to know how to learn, build, and create independently. It showed me that I have what it takes to face challenges and succeed with my own skills and effort.
